## Simple Recipe Site

This is a simple recipe site that provides various delicious recipes using only HTML without any styling. The site consists of a collection of recipes with their ingredients and instructions, allowing users to quickly find and follow the recipes they are interested in.

# Getting Started

To access the recipe site, simply open the "index.html" file in your preferred web browser. No additional setup or installation is required as this is a static HTML site.

# Site Structure

The structure of the site is straightforward, with each recipe presented on its own page. The main components of each recipe page are as follows:

1. Recipe Title: Each recipe has a clear and descriptive title at the top of the page, indicating the dish's name.

2. Ingredients List: Below the recipe title, you will find a list of ingredients required for the recipe. The ingredients are presented in a simple, easy-to-read format.

3. Instructions: Following the ingredients list, there are step-by-step instructions on how to prepare the dish. The instructions are presented in a sequential manner, making it easy for users to follow along.

4. Back to Home Link: At the end of each recipe page, there is a link that allows users to return to the home page where all the recipes are listed.

# Contributing

As this is a simple static HTML site, contributions can be made by editing the HTML files directly. If you have a new recipe to add, simply create a new HTML file for the recipe page following the same structure as the existing ones. Make sure to include the recipe title, ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions. Additionally, add a link to the new recipe page in the home page (index.html) so that users can access it easily.

# License

This simple recipe site is open-source and available under the MIT License. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the site and its contents, as long as the original license terms are followed.

# Acknowledgments

This simple recipe site was created with the intention of providing easy-to-follow recipes to users without the distraction of styling or complex design. It's a starting point for anyone interested in building their own recipe site or learning about basic HTML structures.
