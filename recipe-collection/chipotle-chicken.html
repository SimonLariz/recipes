            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 ¬Ω pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow bowl, place chipotle and ancho chile peppers, then
                pour in water. Cover the bowl and allow the peppers to soften at
                room temperature for 10 to 12 hours. Once softened, drain the
                water and remove the seeds from the peppers.</li>
            <li>In a blender, combine the softened chile peppers, red onion,
                garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper. Blend until
                a coarse paste forms. Add olive oil to the mixture and continue
                blending until the marinade achieves a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>Take the chicken thighs and place them between two sheets of
                heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Use the smooth side of
                a meat mallet to firmly pound the chicken to a 1/2-inch
                thickness.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a resealable plastic bag and add the
                prepared marinade. Turn the chicken several times to ensure it
                is evenly coated with the marinade. Seal the bag and
                refrigerate, allowing the chicken to marinate for at least 8
                hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates to
                medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the marinade bag, discarding the
                marinade.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and
                cook for approximately 5 to 7 minutes, or until the chicken is
                no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. To ensure
                the chicken is fully cooked, an instant-read thermometer
                inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74
                degrees C).</li>
            <li>Once cooked, cut the chicken into strips and serve it warm.</li>
