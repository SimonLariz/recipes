        <h1>Smash Burgers</h1>
        <p>Discover the ultimate Smash Burger recipe - an explosion of juicy
            goodness with irresistibly crispy edges. For optimal results, opt
            for meat no leaner than 80/20 and ensure it's thoroughly chilled. To
            prevent smoke in the kitchen, I recommend cooking these delectable
            patties outdoors. The high heat ensures quick grilling, so have all
            your essentials prepared and ready to go for a seamless cooking
            experience! Get ready to indulge in burger bliss! üçîüçîüçî </p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter,</li>
            <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
            <li>4 6in squares of parchment paper</li>
            <li>salt as needed</li>
            <li>pepper as needed</li>
            <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>toppings of choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare your outdoor grill, preheating it to high heat, and
                lightly oil the grate. Position a cast iron flat-top griddle or
                a large cast iron skillet on the grill and heat until it starts
                smoking.</li>
            <li>Take the buns and spread a layer of butter on their insides,
                toasting them on the flat-top until they achieve a light golden
                brown color. Once toasted, set them aside.</li>
            <li>Next, divide the meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, each weighing
                about 2 ounces. Avoid pressing the meat too tightly, as this
                could hinder proper smashing. Place each ball on the hot
                flat-top and cover it with a piece of parchment paper (which you
                can reuse for a second patty to prevent sticking to the
                spatula). Immediately press down on each ball with two sturdy,
                criss-crossed spatulas or the bottom of a small skillet,
                smashing them to a 1/4 inch thickness. Sprinkle the meat with
                salt for seasoning.</li>
            <li>Grill the patties for approximately 45 seconds, ensuring the
                edges turn dark brown and the centers exhibit a light pink hue.
                Gently lift the patties using a bench scraper or firm spatula,
                flip them over, and promptly cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill
                for an additional 15 to 20 seconds to melt the cheese. Stack the
                plain patties over the cheese-covered ones, creating 4 stacks in
                total.</li>
            <li>Finally, move each stack onto a bun and serve these delectable
                delights with your favorite toppings. Get ready to relish the
                scrumptious flavors of your homemade smash burgers! üçîüî•üçî</li>
